# **Minesweeper Game**

This **Minesweeper** game is a simple implementation in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game follows the classic rules of Minesweeper, where the player must reveal cells on a grid while avoiding hidden bombs. The code also includes features like an undo button and a CPU player for automated moves.

## **Known Issues**

- The CPU does not play right after the main player, the user has to click a button to give it a chance to make a move

## **Future Improvements**

- Better CPU capabilities: we make it able to choose cells strategically not just in order
