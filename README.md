# **Minesweeper Game**

This **Minesweeper** game is a simple implementation in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game follows the classic rules of Minesweeper, where the player must reveal cells on a grid while avoiding hidden bombs. The code also includes features like an undo button and a CPU player for automated moves.

- Better CPU capabilities: we make it able to choose cells strategically not just in order
