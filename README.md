The code also includes features like an undo button and a CPU player for automated moves.

## **Known Issues**

- *The CPU does not play right after the main player, the user has to click a button to give it a chance to make a move*

## **Future Improvements**

- *Better CPU capabilities: we make it able to choose cells strategically not just in order*
